### activity_diagram_1 (Nastasiu Stefan)

### activity_diagram_2 (Nastasiu Stefan)

### activity_diagram_3 (Nastasiu Stefan)

This is the description of a project I need to make UML diagrams for. Can you take this description and provide me activity diagrams (or just one if it's enough) for this project? You can give me the text-based activity diagram, so I can input it in a visualizer.

Description: Build a system to analyze and visualize political sentiment and polarization in social media networks. The tool will detect communities aligned with different political opinions and visualize their polarization level based on sentiment and user interactions.
Features:
Use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to detect political alignment in posts.
Apply community detection to map polarized groups.
Visualize polarized communities with color-coded clusters and the strength of interaction between groups.

---

Requirements analysis (not fully complete):

Our application is a real-time dashboard that fetches live social media data (e.g., from Twitter, Reddit, etc.) and analyzes sentiment in posts and comments. The results will be displayed on an interactive graph where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions (likes, replies, mentions, etc.).

Requirements

Backend:

Microservices architecture
A service that obtains data using the ùïè Api, preprocesses it and stores it in a MongoDb database
A service that generates the graphs representations
A service that trains different types of models and applies sentiment analysis algorithms on the collected data
Login/Register System

Frontend:

The user will login or register to use the application
The user will interact with the application using a dashboard
The user will be able to visualize graphs and different types of diagrams on different political topics
The user will be able to visualize the polarization in social media communities

=================================================================================

can you write me the diagram in PlantUML text-based UML class diagram format?

=================================================================================

Can you improve this diagram even further? Make it more complex? Or build several diagrams

=================================================================================

can you not include backend processes in frontend and make the backend diagram more detailed?

=================================================================================

Perfect! Can you include the option to save a graphical representation generated for a user? An user should be able to save the graph for the live data available at that moment. Modify the diagrams accordingly (Frontend, Backend, MainFlow).

=================================================================================

in backend, the "Save Graph Request Received?" process is placed wrongly before the "Frontend that Data is Ready". Repair this. Also, add the option to visualize saved graphs in all diagrams.

Requirement Analysis for Real-Time Social Media Sentiment and Community Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
The project aims to develop a real-time dashboard that analyzes social media data from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, focusing on public sentiment and community interactions. It will provide sentiment analysis and visualizations, especially for political campaigns, but can extend to other topics such as brand competition. Key features include real-time sentiment analysis, community detection, and interactive graph visualizations that allow users to explore sentiment trends and community structures.

Functional Requirements

1. Data Collection & API Integration
   Social Media Platforms: Fetch real-time data from Twitter, Reddit, and potentially Facebook via APIs.
   Data Frequency: Configurable real-time or near real-time updates.
   Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and data cleaning (removing URLs, dates, special characters). Efficient handling of large datasets through batching.
2. Sentiment Analysis
   Classification: Classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral and detect specific emotions (anger, happiness, sadness).
   Techniques:
   Hybrid models: CNN-LSTM for accurate sentiment analysis.
   Lexicon-based: Use predefined word sentiment scores (SentiWordNet, WordNet) and expand with domain-specific corpora.
   Machine learning: Algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, and CNN-LSTM hybrids.
   Sentiment Scores: Assign polarity scores to posts.
   Multilingual Support: Analyze posts in various languages.
3. Community Detection & Analysis
   Graph Representation:
   Nodes represent users, and edges represent interactions (likes, replies, mentions).
   Community Detection Algorithms:
   Force-directed layouts for large networks, Powergraph analysis for compressed networks, and circular layouts for smaller networks.
   Cluster and Polarization Detection: Identify sentiment-based communities and polarized groups, especially around political campaigns or brands.
   Real-Time Updates: Visualize changes in the network as they occur.

### c4_level_3_base_api_diagram (Lazurca Samuel-Ionut)

My Application has Base Api that is multi-layered. One layer is represented by a middleware for authorization/authentication, layers for controllers, services, repositories, persistence. User data is saved in a PostgreSQL db and data about social media posts are saved in a MongoDb database. Base Api communicates with the Date Collector Api that fetches data and inserts in in the MongoDb once in a while. The Fronted Web Application uses the base api that provides services like: fetching live data, get graph representations of data, the user can save those graphs, the admin ca generate reports and see the users. The data will be analysed to detect political sentiment and communities polarization in social media and it's collected using the X Api. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid and Lexicon approaches will be used. Given this context create a C4 third level/component diagram for the Base Api using PlantUml.
Use an up to date plantUml version
ML analysis is done in base api also
the middleware is before controllers, it should intercept every request
use the c4 notations and colors

### c4_level_3_data_collector_diagram (Lazurca Samuel-Ionut)

Create a C4 third level diagram for a Data Collector API that collects data from X api and saves it in a MongoDb database. It should preprocess it and do feature selection. This Api is used by a Base Api.

### c4_level_3_frontend_diagram (Nastasiu Stefan)

Make me the C4 third level diagram for the Frontend of an application. The Frontend communicates with the User component and also with the Base API. It doesn't communicate with services or database, because all the information is retrieved from Base API. 

The Frontend will be delimited by System_Boundary in the diagram. 

I have the User module like this: (User, A user of the dashboard who analyzes sentiment and community interactions). The User Uses [HTTPS] and has an arrow pointing at the Web Application container (Web Application, [JavaScript, React], Provides an interface for users to visualize data). Then the Web Application container has an arrow titled (User requests are sent to the Base API) and pointing to the Base API container (Base API, [React, NodeJs], Provides the main functionalities of the application).

The application will be a real-time dashboard that fetches live social media data (e.g., from Twitter, Reddit, etc.) and analyzes sentiment in posts and comments. The results will be displayed on an interactive graph where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions (likes, replies, mentions, etc.).

These are the main features of the Frontend Container:
1. The user will login or register to use the application.
2. The user will interact with the application using a dashboard.
3. The user will be able to visualize graphs and different types  of diagrams on different political topics. 
5. The user will be able to visualize the polarization in social media communities
6. The user will be able to save the generated graphs and load them from saved graphs.
