## Bonus for AI Usage

**Bonus up to 4 points for those who use AI to solve laboratory tasks.**

We used **AI**, specifically **ChatGPT**, to assist in solving the tasks. Below is how we utilized AI:

### How AI Was Used:

- **Performance Testing:** ChatGPT suggested using **Locust** for performance testing and provided examples of using **GET** and **POST** methods to test API endpoints.

- **Security Testing:** ChatGPT also suggested testing for **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities, initially proposing Flask for the testing environment. However, We had to adapt this solution to fit our custom setup, as we are using **Node.js** instead of Flask.

### Advantages of Using AI:

- **Time Efficiency:** AI provided a solution quickly, offering suggestions on tools (like Locust) and giving a ready-to-use example to execute the tasks.

- **Guidance:** AI helped structure the approach to solving the problems, saving time on research and enabling quicker implementation.

### Disadvantages of Using AI:

- **Lack of Step-by-Step Details:** AI did not explain every step of the testing process in detail. For example, it didnâ€™t mention key steps like ensuring the server runs on port 5000 to avoid connection issues with Locust. This could lead to some trial and error without further clarification.

- **Adaptation Required for Security Testing:** AI initially suggested testing SQL Injection vulnerabilities using Flask. However, our code environment was based on **Node.js**, so we had to adapt the solution to our setup and use the Node.js server for security testing.

### Files that were made using AI:

- **tests/performance/performance_test.py** 

Execute on application non-functional tests (load or stress or recovery or security or scalability, etc.)

example of code in python

give me an example of each: Execute on application non-functional tests (load or stress or recovery or
security or scalability, etc.)

- **tests/security/sql_injection_test.py** 

explain this in detail: Security Testing
Scope: Checking protection against unauthorized access and common attacks.

write me all the code to get this result: ```{"timestamp": "2024-12-08T12:00:00Z", "action": "Attempted SQL Injection", "page": "/dashboard"}```

and how do I execute the sql injection action?

- **server.js** 

can you do sql injection testing using only nodejs, without flask?

integrate in server.js everything you need to get this behavior
